========
8.3utils
========

Utilities for formatting 8.3 filenames [1] -- mostly intended as a toy project.
Currently only ls is implemented.


Tentative roadmap
=================

- Allow an 8.3 path as an argument
  + This would need a map or bidirectional map (implemented with hash tables)
    between 8.3 and long filenames
- Implement other tools like cd in terms of 8.3 file names
