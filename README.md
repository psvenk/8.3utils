8.3utils
========

Utilities for formatting [8.3 filenames][1] -- mostly intended as a toy
project.  Currently only `ls` is implemented.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename


Tentative roadmap
-----------------

- Allow an 8.3 path as an argument
  + This would need a map or bidirectional map (implemented with hash tables)
    between 8.3 and long filenames
- Implement other tools like `cd` in terms of 8.3 file names

Sample output
-------------

```console
$ ./ls8.3 test
